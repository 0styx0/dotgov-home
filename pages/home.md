**March 2, 2021:** The .gov top-level domain is moving to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. See our [announcement](/moving-to-cisa).

**June 21, 2020:** Today, the DotGov Program announces our **intent to preload the .gov TLD in the future**. We believe the security benefits that come from preloading are meaningful and necessary to continue meeting the public&rsquo;s expectation of safety on .gov services. We believe that government websites should always be secure. Click [here](/management/preloading/dotgovhttps) to learn more about the steps we are taking to reach this goal.

**March 5, 2020:** Effective on March 10, 2020, the DotGov Program will begin requiring notarized signatures on all authorization letters when submitting a request for a new .gov domain. This is a necessary security enhancement to prevent mail and wire fraud through signature forgery in obtaining a .gov domain. This step will help maintain the integrity of .gov and ensure that .gov domains continue to be issued only to official U.S. government organizations.
