To transfer ownership of a domain name from one agency to another agency, two letters must be submitted to us: one from the transferring agency and one from the accepting agency.

Start by copying and pasting the [Domain Transfer Letter Template]({{ site.baseurl }}/domains/management/authorization-templates/transfers/) into a word processor.

### Transferring agency letter

The letter from the transferring agency must be on official agency letterhead and signed by the transferring agency chief information officer (CIO). The letter should formally request that the domain name be transferred to the new agency and should include the following information:

* Both agency names (transferring agency and accepting agency)
* Domain name to be transferred
* Current contacts and phone numbers (for the transferring agency)
* New contacts and phone numbers (for the accepting agency)

### Accepting agency letter

The letter from the accepting agency must be on official agency letterhead and must be signed by the accepting agency CIO.

This letter must specify the request for ownership of the domain name and should include the following information:

* Both agency names (transferring agency and accepting agency)
* Domain name to be transferred
* Current contacts and phone numbers (for the transferring agency)
* New contacts and phone numbers (for the accepting agency)
* New [domain name server]({{ site.baseurl/support/dns/}}) addresses

### Submit your request

Fax your authorization letter to 540-301-0160 or email a copy to registrar@dotgov.gov.

After we receive and verify both letters, the registry will be updated to reflect the transfer.
