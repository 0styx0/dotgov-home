# Points of contact (POCs)

Each domain must have 3 points of contact (POC) for the domain.  There will be no one single point of contact.

All points of contact must have authority to have an account on the Registration System. An email must be received from a point of contact that is currently on the domain to authorize a Change or Delete for the domain.

### What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

The Admin POC must be from the signatory’s office. For example, the Admin POC for a new state domain name must be in the governor’s office.

The Technical POC must be available 24/7 if this .gov domain name is critical to your infrastructure.

The Billing POC must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

### What steps does a new POC need to take to get set up?

Request an account by sending an email to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

For a new domain request, the [authorization letter](/domains/registration/form-letters/) must also list the POC as a valid contact.
