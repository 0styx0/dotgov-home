## New to .gov
*This section describes the process for those without any .gov domain names.*

### Step 1: Prepare and send the authorization letter

1. [Check](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/registration/whois.xhtml) to see if the domain you want is available.

2. Review the .gov [domain requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/) that all domains are subject to.

3. Evaluate who the [authorizing authority]({{site.baseurl}}/help/#whats-an-authorizing-authority-and-who-is-ours) is for your organization type (federal, state, city/county, etc.). Then, use the appropriate [template]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/) to prepare an **authorization letter** to request approval for the domain:

    a. Place the template text into a document on official letterhead.

    b. Update the template with information relevant to your organization. This includes domain contacts, an [administrative and a technical contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/#what-contact-information-do-we-need-to-keep-updated). We recommend adding a [security contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/security-best-practices/#add-a-security-contact), which allows the public to report observed or suspected security issues at your domain. *Security contact details are made public.*
      > **Note**: Though domains are now [available at no cost]({{site.baseurl}}/2021/4/27/a-new-day-for-gov/), a legacy contact, *the billing contact*, remains. You may consider it a secondary administrative contact.

    c. Have your authorizing authority sign the document.

5. Send your signed authorization letter (in PDF) to <registrar@dotgov.gov>.

Once we receive your authorization letter, we will work to verify the authenticity of the request (including with your authorizing authority) and create .gov registrar accounts for each domain contact.

### Step 2: Complete the online form

After each [domain contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/#what-contact-information-do-we-need-to-keep-updated) has logged in to establish their account, any of them can complete the online domain request form sent to them at <https://domains.dotgov.gov>. The form asks for some information you've already collected with the authorization letter, and allows you to submit name server information for your .gov domain. (This can also be added after domain approval.)

Once the online form is complete, we will review the request. If approved, you'll be given the opportunity to complete any missing information, like name server addresses. Your domain will not be active in the .gov zone until your name servers are answering authoritatively.

### Security best practices

Before you launch your new domain, we strongly recommend that you review our [domain security best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/help/security-best-practices/). Each recommendation can increase the resiliency of your online services while protecting your organization and its users.

## Get another .gov domain

If you already have a .gov registrar account, [log in](https://domains.dotgov.gov) and then click '_Registration_' > '_Register a domain_'. After completing the domain request form, you will also need to [prepare and send an authorization letter](#step-1-prepare-and-send-the-authorization-letter).
