## Accounts and Points of Contact (POC)

#### What is a POC?

A POC serves as a contact on a domain. There are three types: Billing, Technical, and Administrator.

#### Can one person serve as multiple POCs on a single domain?

No. All POCs on a domain must be **_unique_** to prevent a single point of failure. Each domain will require three (3) distinct POCs before submitting a request for approval or before submitting a renewal payment.

#### Can one person serve as a POC on multiple domains?

Yes.

#### One of the POCs is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. We need to remove him/her. How do I do that?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.

To change a single POC on the account, the Administrative POC will need to send an email to <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>, and request the change of POC. If the new POC already has an account on the system, please provide the Username for the account and which POC the user will replace. If the new POC does not currently have an account, please send the name and contact information to <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a> so an account can be set up for them. For federal level domains, the email must come from a Government employee.

If all three POCs have left the domain, The Authorizing Authority must assign 3 more POCs in a new authorization letter.

The Guidelines for the Gov Domain section 1, h., states:

It is the registrant's responsibility to provide all requested information and keep all account information current, to include POC information, DNS information and ensure the account is paid in full each year. Government domains / websites can be very large, complex and support important business operations. The process to address policy violations will allow for coordination across organizational boundaries and involve persons with the authority to make decisions on the appropriate course of action and in the time frame required.  The Administrative POC is the person who controls the content and is the manager of the operations of the domain.  The Technical POC is the person that operates the DNS and takes care of technical operations such as security patches, programming, etc. The Billing POC is the person that pays for the domain. The Authorizing Authority is the highest IT official or highest elected official that authorizes the domain to operate and contain information reference to their government responsibilities. The Authorizing Authority for Federal Agency domains is the CIO. The Authorizing Authority for State level domains is the Governor or their appointed CIO. The Authorizing Authority for local governments and Native Sovereign Nations is the highest elected official or the highest IT official.


#### How do I reset my password?

If you do not recall your password, please contact the Help Desk and a temporary password will be generated for you. You will be prompted to change your password for security protocols.

#### How quickly will modifications to my domain propagate throughout the Internet?

Propagation depends on a variety of factors, such as caching and connectivity, the changes are usually effective by the next morning.

#### What are the steps that should be taken to remove a domain and delete it from the .gov system?

Only a registered POC on a domain may request deletion of a domain by sending an email to the .GOV Registrar at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov). In addition to requesting the domain to be deleted, the domain owner should request the resource records for that domain to be removed from the zone file on the nameservers hosting the domain.

#### Why wonâ€™t my domain work after updating the registration with actual name servers?

Adding name servers to a reserved domain does not change its status from reserved to active if other requirements are pending. You are permitted to reserve a domain for up to 90 days, giving you time to submit all of the required registration information.

If the name server information is the only remaining information required for registration, it will take approximately 1 to 2 days following receipt of valid name server data for .gov Domain Registration Services to activate your domain. Expect an additional 1 to 2 days for the update to propagate across the Internet.
