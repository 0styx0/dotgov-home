## Domain registration

#### How do I register a .gov domain?

To register a domain, please review the materials located on the Registration Process tab.

#### Do I need to enter DNS information when I submit my registration request?

You can add DNS at any time once the domain name request has been submitted. Note: Your domain cannot be activated until you add DNS.

#### My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the General Services Administration ([https://www.gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov)). Please contact the Domain Registration Help Desk with any questions you may have.

Toll-free: (877) REG-GOVT or (877) 734-4688<br/>
E-mail: <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>

#### How long is a .Gov domain registered?

Domains are registered for a 1 year period and are renewed annually.

#### If a POC for a domain is new, are there any steps that this person needs to take to become the POC?

Yes, a new POC must first request an account by sending an email to Help Desk at <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>. For a new domain request, the authorization letter must list the POC as a valid contact. Please go to <a href="https://www.dotgov.gov"> and then go to Home < Forms for this authorization letter template.

#### What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

#### What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

The Admin POC must be from the signatory's office. For example, the Admin POC for a new state domain name must be in the governor's office. The Technical POC must be available 24/7 if this .Gov domain name is critical to your infrastructure. The Billing POC must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

#### One of the POCs is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. We need to remove him/her. How do I do that?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If your POC is new, that individual must be provisioned into the system beforehand by selecting Account on the login page ([www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov)). Please review [the corresponding FAQ section](#one-of-the-pocs-is-no-longer-the-right-person-to-help-manage-a-domain-we-need-to-remove-himher-how-do-i-do-that) for more details.

If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.

#### Our CIO won't sign our authorization letter. What do we do now?

Without an Authorization Letter from your Mayor or the highest ranking city or county official, the State Governor, the State CIO, or the Federal CIO of your Federal agency, you cannot register for a .gov domain name.

#### Are states eligible to receive a .gov domain?
