# Domain registration

## How do I register a .gov domain?

1. Complete .gov Domain Registration at [dotgov.gov](https://dotgov.gov).

  - The name of .gov domain must be consistent with content.
  - Authorization Letter Template can be found under the Forms tab on the left.
  - Each Point of Contact must be unique if the POC already has a Username on the system just include their name and account Username.
  - Authorization letter must be on official letterhead stationary.
  - Letter must be signed by Agency Head or the CIO.
  - Please fax a copy of the letter to 540-301-0160 or scan and email to <registrar@dotgov.gov>.
 - If you are registering a Federal Executive Branch Agency domain, please read the [Policies for Dot Gov Domain Issuance for Federal Agency Public Websites Memorandum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150513215856/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/memo/policies-for-dot-gov-domain-issuance-for-federal-agency-public-websites.pdf).

2. Accounts

  - A .gov helpdesk representative will create the accounts needed and email the POC to finalize the account and new password.
  - The Content or Administrative POC approves all content (must be a government employee); Technical POC is usually responsible for the DNS or programming.

3. DNS information must be complete

  - Each domain must have at least one domain name Server.
  - Host DNS must be populated before domain activation.

4. Billing POC must pay for the domain with a Credit Card

  - After receipt of the authorization letter and DNS test pass, an email will be generated allowing for the domain to be paid for and activated.

If you have any questions during the registration process, contact us at <registrar@dotgov.gov> or 1-877-734-4688.


## Do I need to enter DNS information when I submit my registration request?

You can add DNS at any time once the domain name request has been submitted. Note: Your domain cannot be activated until you add DNS.

## My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the General Services Administration ([https://www.gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov)). Please contact the Domain Registration Help Desk with any questions you may have.

Toll-free: (877) REG-GOVT or (877) 734-4688<br/>
Email: <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>

## If a POC for a domain is new, are there any steps that this person needs to take to become the POC?

Yes, a new POC must first request an account by sending an email to Help Desk at <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>. For a new domain request, the authorization letter must list the POC as a valid contact. Please go to <a href="https://www.dotgov.gov"> and then go to Home < Forms for this authorization letter template.

## What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

## What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

The Admin POC must be from the signatory's office. For example, the Admin POC for a new state domain name must be in the governor's office. The Technical POC must be available 24/7 if this .gov domain name is critical to your infrastructure. The Billing POC must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

## Our CIO won't sign our authorization letter. What do we do now?

Without an Authorization Letter from your Mayor or the highest ranking city or county official, the State Governor, the State CIO, or the Federal CIO of your Federal agency, you cannot register for a .gov domain name.

## Where do I send my Authorization Letter?

Fax your letter to: (540) 301-0160 or email a digital copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).
