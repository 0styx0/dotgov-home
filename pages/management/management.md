Domain management is about more than just [DNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/dns/). It's also about ensuring a safe experience for your organization and your users.

## Points of Contact
Keeping point of contact (POC) information from going stale ensures that only the appropriate people can make changes to your domain. It also makes it possible for DotGov to reach your organization when there's an issue.

### How do I set up a new point of contact?

Request an account by sending an email to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

For a new domain request, the [authorization letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/) must also list the person’s name as a valid contact.

### How do I change a point of contact on the account?

**If the point of contact is new** and doesn't have a account of the .gov registrar, they can create one in the [Account section of domains.dotgov.gov](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/user/register_registrant.xhtml?_m=2). We will then verity with another POC that they should have access.

**If the point of contact already has an account** on the .gov registrar, please provide the username for the account and which point of contact the user will replace. If the new point of contact does not currently have an account, please send the name and contact information so an account can be set up for them. For federal level domains the email must come from a government employee.

**If all three points of contact have left the domain**, the Authorizing Authority must sign a new authorization letter and assign 3 more points of contact.

Review our [account information guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#account-information) for more details.

### One of our contacts is no longer the right person to help manage our domain. How do I remove them from the account?

If you are a contact on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you can update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you’re selecting an existing user.

If you are unable to update a point of contact with an existing user, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).

### Can one person serve as multiple POCs on a single domain?

No. All POCs on a domain must be **_unique_** to prevent a single point of failure. Each domain will require three (3) distinct POCs before submitting a request for approval or before submitting a renewal payment.

### Can one person serve as a POC on multiple domains?

Yes.


## Renewals and deletions
Some surprises are wonderful. Discovering your domain is no longer on the internet won't be one of them.

### How long is a .gov domain registered for?

Domains are registered for a one year period and can be renewed annually.

### Where can I get a list of my domains that are up for renewal?

On [domains.dotgov.gov](https://domains.dotgov.gov), from the Home tab, click Fees**.

### How do I delete my domain?

If you'd like to delete a domain name, [contact us](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov) from an account registered to the domain. Also, you should ask your DNS provider to remove your domain's resource records.

Warning: once a domain is deleted, the entire [registration process]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/) must be initiated to recover the domain. Be certain you want to delete a domain name before contacting us.

### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain names are not automatically removed from the zone. However, they may be placed in a hold status. If any of your domain names are held, the services attached to them are likely to be impacted.

If you do not wish to renew, please contact us to delete the domain.
