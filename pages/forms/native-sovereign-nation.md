[Tribal government letterhead]

[Date]

.Gov Domain Registration\
c/o Verisign, Inc.\
12061 Bluemont Way\
Reston, Virginia 20190

To the .gov Program:

As [[authorizing authority]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#native-sovereign-nation-tribal-domains)] for [Tribe recognized by the Federal or a State government], I request that responsibility for the domain name [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] be delegated to my tribe.

[*Briefly describe the mission or initiative that drives the domain name request, explaining what the domain name will be used for. Include links to, or add as an appendix, authorizing Tribal resolution, legislation, applicable bylaws or charter, or other documentation that demonstrates you tribe has been recognized by the Federal or a State government.*]

In order to obtain and maintain [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov] [Tribe] will meet the general and specific requirements for federal agencies, found at [https://home.dotgov.gov/registration/requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/).

The following will be listed as contacts for [\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.gov], which [Tribe] will keep up to date in the .gov registrar.

[*Administrative, billing, and technical contacts are named individuals and must be unique; a security contact should generally be a team email address.*

*As of April 26, 2021, .gov domains no longer have a fee associated with them. However, the .gov registrar has not yet been updated to remove the billing contact role. Until then, you may consider the billing contact to be a secondary administrative contact.*]
