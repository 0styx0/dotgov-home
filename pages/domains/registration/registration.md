To register and activate a new .gov domain:

1. [Create a dotgov.gov account](https://www.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/user/register_registrant.xhtml?_m=2) or [sign into an existing account](https://www.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/welcome.xhtml?_m=1).

A .gov representative will create your account and email the point of contact to finalize the account and create a password.

2. If you are registering a domain for a Federal Executive Branch Agency, please read the [Policies for Dot Gov Domain Issuance for Federal Agency Public Websites Memorandum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150513215856/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/memo/policies-for-dot-gov-domain-issuance-for-federal-agency-public-websites.pdf).

3. Prepare the authorization letter to request approval.

- Copy and paste an [Authorization Letter Template](/domains/registration/form-letters/) into a word processor.

- Update the letter with the appropriate information for your request.

- The name of .gov domain must be consistent with its content.

- The letter must be on official letterhead stationary, with a signature from your agency head or CIO.

4. Specify three points of contact (POCs).

The Content or Administrative POC approves all content (and must be a government employee). The Technical POC is usually responsible for the DNS or programming.

Each point of contact (POC) must be unique. If a POC already has a username in the system, include their name and username.

5. Complete your DNS information.

Each domain must have at least one domain name server.

Your host DNS must be populated before your domain is activated.

6. Send a copy of the authorization letter to:

* Fax: 540-301-0160
* Email: <registrar@dotgov.gov>

After we receive your authorization letter and DNS test pass, you’ll receive an email that allows you to activate the domain.

## Common questions

If you have any questions during the registration process, contact us at <registrar@dotgov.gov> or 1-877-734-4688.

### What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

### Do I need to enter DNS information when I submit my registration request?

You can add DNS at any time once the domain name request has been submitted. Note: Your domain cannot be activated until you add DNS.

### Why won’t my domain work after updating the registration with actual name servers?

Adding name servers to a reserved domain does not change its status from reserved to active if other requirements are pending. You are permitted to reserve a domain for up to 90 days, giving you time to submit all of the required registration information.

If the name server information is the only remaining information required for registration, it will take approximately 1 to 2 days following receipt of valid name server data for .gov Domain Registration Services to activate your domain. Expect an additional 1 to 2 days for the update to propagate across the Internet.

### Our CIO won’t sign our authorization letter. What do we do now?

Without an authorization letter from your mayor or the highest ranking city or county official, the state governor, the state CIO, or the federal CIO of your federal agency, you cannot register for a .gov domain name.

### Where do I send my authorization letter?

Fax your letter to 540-301-0160 or email a copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

### My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the General Services Administration ([https://www.gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov)). Please contact the Domain Registration Help Desk with any questions you may have.
