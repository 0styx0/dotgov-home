Each domain must have three points of contact. There will be no one single point of contact. Each contact must have the authority to access the Dotgov.gov registration system.

#### 1. Administrative contact

The administrative contact must be from the signatory’s office. As an example, for a state domain, it must be someone in the governor’s office.

#### 2. Technical contact

The technical contact must be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week if this domain is critical to your infrastructure.

#### 3. Billing contact

The billing contact must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.
