## Domain management

### How quickly will modifications to my domain propagate throughout the internet?

Propagation depends on a variety of factors, such as caching and connectivity, the changes are usually effective by the next morning.

### What are the steps that should be taken to remove a domain and delete it from the .gov system?

Only a registered POC on a domain may request deletion of a domain by sending an email to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov). In addition to requesting the domain to be deleted, the domain owner should request the resource records for that domain to be removed from the zone file on the nameservers hosting the domain.
