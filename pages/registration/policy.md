### Supplementary information

#### A. Background

The purpose of this final rule is to provide a new policy for the Internet GOV Domain that will be included in the FMR. The final rule is written in a plain language question and answer format. This style uses an active voice, shorter sentences, and pronouns. Unless otherwise indicated in the text, the pronoun "we" refers to the General Services Administration (GSA). A question and its answer combine to establish a rule. You must follow the language contained in both the question and its answer.

This final rule establishes FMR part 102-173, Internet GOV Domain, and provides policy for registration of domain names. A proposed rule was published in the Federal Register at 67 FR 34890, May 16, 2002. Public comments were solicited for use in the formulation of the final rule. All comments were consolidated and each one considered through a formal process. Comments received were from private citizens, Federal, State, and local government organizations, information technology standards organizations, and commercial businesses. Particularly worth noting are the comments concerning the cost for dot-gov registration. GSA currently assesses no charge. The rule merely establishes a ceiling for the charges that GSA may assess in the future if circumstances require it. These charges, if established, will be based on the costs of operations and market rates. An earlier regulation was previously located in the Federal Property Management Regulation (FPMR) (41 CFR part 101-35, subpart 101-35.7, Network Address Registration) and expired on August 8, 2001.

Jurisdiction of the Internet GOV (dot-gov) domain was delegated to GSA in 1997 by the Federal Networking Council with guidance in the form of Internet Engineering Task Force Informational [RFC 2146](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2146.txt?number=2146). Since then, the U.S. Government use of the Internet has evolved and is rapidly emerging as an electronic government without boundaries. Federal organizations are choosing dot-gov domain names to reflect the type of service being rendered and are collaborating to form portals that cross boundaries of agencies, departments, and other U.S. government entities. GSA reserves the right to make exceptions to the naming conventions described in this subpart on a case-by-case basis in unique and compelling cases.

In addition, there is increasing interest from non-Federal U.S. government entities, such as State and [[Page 15090]] local governments, and Federally recognized Indian tribes, known in this rule as Native Sovereign Nations (NSNs), to provide service within the dot-gov domain. Many such governmental entities believe that their citizens are likely to associate their government at all levels with the dot-gov domain, and therefore, want the additional option of positioning their governmental portal to the public within this space. GSA has entered into an agreement with the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian Affairs to facilitate the registration of NSNs in the dot-gov domain.

#### B. Executive Order 12866

This is a significant rule and was subject to Office of Management and Budget review under section 6(b) of Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, dated September 30, 1993.

#### C. Regulatory Flexibility Act

We certify that the amendments will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities, because the registration and renewal fees, and paperwork collection burden will be small.

#### D. Paperwork Reduction Act

The Paperwork Reduction Act does not apply because this final rule does not contain any information collection requirements that require the approval of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under 44 U.S.C. 3501, et seq.

#### E. Congressional Review Act

This final rule is not a major rule under 5 U.S.C. 804.

#### F. Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995

This final rule does not significantly or uniquely affect small governments or tribal governments. It does not result in expenditures by State, local, or tribal governments, or to the private sector, of $100 million or more in any one year.

#### G. Executive Order 13132 on Federalism

This final rule does not have Federalism implications. There are no substantial direct effects on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.

#### List of Subjects in 41 CFR Part 102-173

Archives and records, Computer technology, Federal information processing resources activities, Government procurement, Property management, Records management, Telecommunications.
