## Domain name integrity

To maintain domain name integrity, eligibility is limited to qualified government organizations and programs. Having a managed domain name such as .gov assures your customers that they are accessing an official U.S. government site.

## DS changes

Delegation of Signing (DS) records can be assigned to domain names at registration, as well as after the domain name is active. Prior to your DS records being published in the .gov zone, they will be tested and verified.

## DNS changes

Domain names will not be active in the .gov zone until the nameservers assigned to the domain are answering authoritatively. You do not need to enter nameserver details when initiating the registration. However, they will need to be entered within 90 days of the registration request being made. Otherwise, your request may become deactivated and the domain name released for others to use.

## SSL certificate verification

SSL Certificate Authorities can contact us at (877) 734-4688 to verify Administrative point of contact information before issuing an SSL Certificate for a .gov domain name.

Due to security reasons, this information can only be provided verbally. The information cannot be provided in writing.
