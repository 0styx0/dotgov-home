## Accounts and Points of Contact (POC)

#### What is a POC?

A POC serves as a contact on a domain. There are three types: Billing, Technical, and Administrator.

#### Can one person serve as multiple POCs on a single domain?

No. All POCs on a domain must be **_unique_** to prevent a single point of failure. Each domain will require three (3) distinct POCs before submitting a request for approval or before submitting a renewal payment.

#### Can one person serve as a POC on multiple domains?

Yes.

#### One of the POCs is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. We need to remove him/her. How do I do that?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.

To change a single POC on the account, the Administrative POC will need to send an email to <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>, and request the change of POC. If the new POC already has an account on the system, please provide the Username for the account and which POC the user will replace. If the new POC does not currently have an account, please send the name and contact information to <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a> so an account can be set up for them. For federal level domains, the email must come from a Government employee.

If all three POCs have left the domain, The Authorizing Authority must assign 3 more POCs in a new authorization letter.

The Guidelines for the Gov Domain section 1, h., states:

It is the registrant's responsibility to provide all requested information and keep all account information current, to include POC information, DNS information and ensure the account is paid in full each year. Government domains / websites can be very large, complex and support important business operations. The process to address policy violations will allow for coordination across organizational boundaries and involve persons with the authority to make decisions on the appropriate course of action and in the time frame required.  The Administrative POC is the person who controls the content and is the manager of the operations of the domain.  The Technical POC is the person that operates the DNS and takes care of technical operations such as security patches, programming, etc. The Billing POC is the person that pays for the domain. The Authorizing Authority (AA) is the highest IT official or highest elected official that authorizes the domain to operate and contain information reference to their government responsibilities. The AA for Federal Agency domains is the CIO. The AA for State level domains is the Governor or their appointed CIO. The AA for local governments and Native Sovereign Nations is the highest elected official or the highest IT official.

## Domain Registration

#### How do I register a .gov domain?

To register a domain, please review the materials located on the Registration Process tab.

#### Do I need to enter DNS information when I submit my registration request?

You can add DNS at any time once the domain name request has been submitted. Note: Your domain cannot be activated until you add DNS.

#### My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the General Services Administration ([https://www.gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov)). Please contact the Domain Registration Help Desk with any questions you may have.

Toll-free: (877) REG-GOVT or (877) 734-4688<br/>
E-mail: <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>

#### How long is a .Gov domain registered?

Domains are registered for a 1 year period and are renewed annually.

#### If a POC for a domain is new, are there any steps that this person needs to take to become the POC?

Yes, a new POC must first request an account by sending an email to Help Desk at <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>. For a new domain request, the authorization letter must list the POC as a valid contact. Please go to <a href="https://www.dotgov.gov"> and then go to Home < Forms for this authorization letter template.

#### What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

#### What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

The Admin POC must be from the signatory's office. For example, the Admin POC for a new state domain name must be in the governor's office. The Technical POC must be available 24/7 if this .Gov domain name is critical to your infrastructure. The Billing POC must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

#### One of the POCs is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. We need to remove him/her. How do I do that?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If your POC is new, that individual must be provisioned into the system beforehand by selecting Account on the login page ([www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov)). Please review [the corresponding FAQ section](#one-of-the-pocs-is-no-longer-the-right-person-to-help-manage-a-domain-we-need-to-remove-himher-how-do-i-do-that) for more details.

If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.

#### Our CIO won't sign our authorization letter. What do we do now?

Without an Authorization Letter from your Mayor or the highest ranking city or county official, the State Governor, the State CIO, or the Federal CIO of your Federal agency, you cannot register for a .gov domain name.

#### Are states eligible to receive a .gov domain?

Yes, states are eligible to receive a .gov domain name if the authorization letter is signed by the Governor or State CIO.

#### Where do I send my Authorization Letter?

Fax your letter to: (540) 301-0160 or email a digital copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

## Domain Management

#### How do I reset my password?

If you do not recall your password, please contact the Help Desk and a temporary password will be generated for you. You will be prompted to change your password for security protocols.

#### How quickly will modifications to my domain propagate throughout the Internet?

Propagation depends on a variety of factors, such as caching and connectivity, the changes are usually effective by the next morning.

#### What are the steps that should be taken to remove a domain and delete it from the .gov system?

Only a registered POC on a domain may request deletion of a domain by sending an email to the .GOV Registrar at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov). In addition to requesting the domain to be deleted, the domain owner should request the resource records for that domain to be removed from the zone file on the nameservers hosting the domain.

#### Why won't my domain work after updating the registration with actual name servers?

Adding name servers to a reserved domain does not change its status from reserved to active if other requirements are pending. You are permitted to reserve a domain for up to 90 days, giving you time to submit all of the required registration information.

If the name server information is the only remaining information required for registration, it will take approximately 1 to 2 days following receipt of valid name server data for .gov Domain Registration Services to activate your domain. Expect an additional 1 to 2 days for the update to propagate across the Internet.

#### Where can I get a list of domains that are up for renewal?

On [www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov), from the Home Tab click on Fees.

#### How do I transfer ownership of a domain name from one organization to another organization (such as from one agency to another agency)?

To transfer ownership of a domain name from one agency to another agency, two letters must be submitted to the .Gov Domain Manager - one from the transferring agency and one from the accepting agency.

The letter from the transferring agency must be on official agency letterhead and signed by the transferring agency chief information officer (CIO). The letter should formally request that the domain name be transferred to the new agency and should include the following information:

* Both agency names (transferring agency and accepting agency)
* Domain name to be transferred
* Current POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the transferring agency)
* New POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the accepting agency).

The letter from the accepting agency must be on official agency letterhead and must be signed by the accepting agency CIO.

This letter must specify the request for ownership of the domain name and should include the following information:

* Both agency names (transferring agency and accepting agency)
* Domain name to be transferred
* Current POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the transferring agency)
* New POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the accepting agency) and
* New domain name server (DNS) information.

Request letters should be faxed to the attention of the .Gov Domain Manager, at (540) 301-0160 or email a digital copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov). After the .Gov Domain Manager has received and verified both letters, the .Gov Domain Registration database will be updated to reflect the transfer.

## Fees

#### What are current registration fees?

The current cost of a .gov domain name is $400 per year.

#### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Domain name(s) must be renewed annually. POCs are sent renewal reminder emails at various intervals. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your .Gov domain name(s) are removed from active status, any services attached to such domain name(s) may experience issues.

#### What is the form of payment for .gov domain names?

The only form of payment that is accepted is credit cards. We do not accept any other form of payment.

#### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain name(s) do not automatically get removed from the zone. If you do not wish to renew, a registered POC must submit written consent requesting removal of the domain, otherwise, the agency will be held financially responsible for registration fees under Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35 and Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40. Written consent can be emailed to the Help Desk at registrar@dotgov.gov.

What happens if I fail to sumit a payment?
Failure to submit payment does not result in removal of your domain. The entity or agency will be held financially responsible for all accrued registration fees under [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=pt41.3.102_6173&rgn=div5) and [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=pt41.3.102_6173&rgn=div5). Your entity or agency will not be able to acquire new domains until your account is up to date.  If you wish to delete your domain, a registered POC must submit written consent requesting deletion to the Help Desk at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).
