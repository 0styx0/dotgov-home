## Account changes

### Points of contact

Each domain must have 3 points of contact (POC) for the domain.  There will be no one single point of contact.

All points of contact must have authority to have an account on the Registration System. An email must be received from a point of contact that is currently on the domain to authorize a Change or Delete for the domain.

To change a single point of contact on the account, the Administrative point of contact will send an email to the Registrar, email <registrar@dotgov.gov>, and request the change of point of contact for the account. If the new point of contact already has an account on the system, please provide the Username for the account and which point of contact the user will replace. If the new point of contact does not currently have an account, please send the name and contact information so an account can be set up for them. For federal level domains the email must come from a Government employee.

If all three points of contact’s have left the domain, The Authorizing Authority will assign 3 more points of contact in a new authorization letter.

The Guidelines for the Gov Domain section 1, h., states:

> It is the registrant’s responsibility to provide all requested information and keep all account information current; to include point of contact information, DNS information and it is the registrant’s responsibility to ensure the account is paid in full each year. Government domains / websites can be very large, complex and support important business operations. The process to address policy violations will allow for coordination across organizational boundaries and involve persons with the authority to make decisions on the appropriate course of action and in the timeframe required. The Administrative point of contact is the person who controls the content of the domain and is the manager of the operations of the domain. The Technical POC is the person that operates the DNS and takes care of technical operations such as security patches, programming etc. The Billing POC is the person that pays for the domain. The Authorizing Authority (AA) is the highest IT official or highest elected official that authorizes the domain to operate and contain information reference to their government responsibilities. The AA for Federal Agency domains is the CIO. The AA for State level domains is the Governor or their appointed CIO. The AA for local governments and Native Sovereign Nations is the highest elected official or the highest IT official.

### One of our points of contact is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. How do I remove them from the account?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If your POC is new, that individual must be provisioned into the system beforehand by selecting Account on the login page ([www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov)). Please review [the corresponding FAQ section](#one-of-the-pocs-is-no-longer-the-right-person-to-help-manage-a-domain-we-need-to-remove-himher-how-do-i-do-that) for more details.

If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.
