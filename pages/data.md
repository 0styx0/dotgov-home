# .Gov domain data

The official public list of .gov domains is updated roughly every two weeks:

* [List of .gov domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSA/data/gh-pages/dotgov-domains/current-full.csv) - Includes federal, state, local, and tribal `.gov` and `.fed.us` domains.
* [List of federal .gov domains](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GSA/data/gh-pages/dotgov-domains/current-federal.csv) - Includes federal `.gov` and `.fed.us` domains only. A subset of the full list, published separately for convenience.

To give us feedback about this data, [open an issue on our GitHub repository](https://github.com/gsa/data/issues).
