Each domain must have three points of contact (POCs):

* Admin POC
* Technical POC
* Billing POC

There will be no one single point of contact.

### What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

1. The Admin POC must be from the signatory’s office. For example, the Admin POC for a new state domain name must be in the governor’s office.

2. The Technical POC must be available 24/7 if this .gov domain name is critical to your infrastructure.

3. The Billing POC must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

All points of contact must have authority to have an account on the Registration System. An email must be received from a point of contact that is currently on the domain to authorize a Change or Delete for the domain.

### How do we set up a new point of contact?

Request an account by sending an email to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

For a new domain request, the [authorization letter](/domains/registration/form-letters/) must also list the POC as a valid contact.
