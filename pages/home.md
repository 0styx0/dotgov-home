**June 21, 2020:** Today, the DotGov Program announces our **intent to preload the .gov TLD in the future**. We believe the security benefits that come from preloading are meaningful and necessary to continue meeting the public&rsquo;s expectation of safety on .gov services. We believe that government websites should always be secure. Click [here](/management/preloading/dotgovhttps) to learn more about the steps we are taking to reach this goal.

**March 5, 2020:** Effective on March 10, 2020, the DotGov Program will begin requiring notarized signatures on all authorization letters when submitting a request for a new .gov domain. This is a necessary security enhancement to prevent mail and wire fraud through signature forgery in obtaining a .gov domain. This step will help maintain the integrity of .gov and ensure that .gov domains continue to be issued only to official U.S. government organizations.

**July 17, 2019:**  We're implementing a new DNS security measure for all .gov domains to help mitigate future risks associated with [DNS hijacking incidents](https://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/current-activity/2019/01/10/DNS-Infrastructure-Hijacking-Campaign). Click [here](https://home.dotgov.gov/management/#will-i-be-notified-if-a-change-is-made-to-my-dns-information) to learn more about DotGov's new DNS auto-notification emails.

**December 6, 2018:**  You can now add a [security contact]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/security-best-practices/#add-a-security-contact) to the .gov registrar. See our new [domain security best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/security-best-practices/).
