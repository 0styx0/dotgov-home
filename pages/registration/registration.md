## Review our policies

Before you register a new domain, review the .gov [domain requirements]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/), policies and guidelines that all .gov domains are subject to.

## Prepare to make your request

1. Check to see if the [domain is available](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/registration/whois.xhtml?_m=3).

1. Prepare an authorization letter to request approval for the domain:

    - Copy and paste an [Authorization Letter Template]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/) into a word processor, and update the letter with the appropriate information for your request.
    - Define [three points of contact](#specify-three-points-of-contact)
    - The letter must be on official letterhead stationary, with a signature from your agency head or CIO.

### Specify three points of contact

Each domain must have three points of contact, which your letter must detail:

1. **Administrative contact**: someone from the signatory’s office that will approve the content. This person must be a government employee. As an example, for a state domain, it must be someone in the governor’s office.

2. **Technical contact**: a developer or site administrator that is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week if the domain is critical to your infrastructure. They are usually responsible for the [DNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/dns/).

3. **Billing contact**: a person with access to a government credit card and the ability to pay registration fees.

There must be no one single point of contact.

Each contact must have the authority to access the .gov registrar. If a contact already has a .gov registrar username, please include it along with their name.


## Complete the online form

### Sign in or create an account

1. If you’re new to the site, [create an account](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/user/register_registrant.xhtml?_m=2). A Dotgov.gov representative will email the Authorizing Authority for your agency to finalize the account and set a temporary password.

1. Otherwise, [sign in](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/welcome.xhtml?_m=1).

1. Click **Register a Domain**.

1. Add your three points of contact.

### Complete your DNS information

If you know the [name server addresses]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/dns/) for your new domain, enter them now. You have up to 90 days from the registration request to add the name servers. Otherwise, your request may become deactivated and the domain name released for others to use.

Please note that your domain will not be active in the .gov zone until the name servers are answering authoritatively.

### Submit your request

1. Click **Submit**.

1. Fax your authorization letter to 540-301-0160 or email a copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

After we receive your authorization letter and DNS test pass, you’ll receive an email that allows you to activate the domain.
