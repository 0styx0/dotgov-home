Before you try to register a domain, please review our policies and guidelines:

* The Dotgov.gov program is governed by [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2003-03-28/html/03-7413.htm).

* Federal Executive Branch domains are also subject to [Policies for .gov Domain Issuance for Federal Agency Public Websites Memorandum](http://web.archive.org/web/20150513215856/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/egov/memo/policies-for-dot-gov-domain-issuance-for-federal-agency-public-websites.pdf).

* All .gov and .fed.us domains are subject to our [domain requirements](/registration/requirements/).

## Prepare to make your request

1. Check to see if the [domain is available](https://www.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/registration/whois.xhtml?_m=3).

1. Prepare an authorization letter to request approval for the domain:

    - Copy and paste an [Authorization Letter Template]({{base.url}}/domains/registration/authorization-templates/) into a word processor.
    - Update the letter with the appropriate information for your request.
    - Make sure the domain name is consistent with its content.
    - The letter must be on official letterhead stationary, with a signature from your agency head or CIO.

## Complete the online form

### Sign in or create an account

1. If you’re new to the site, [create an account](https://www.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/user/register_registrant.xhtml?_m=2). A Dotgov.gov representative will email the Authorizing Authority for your agency to finalize the account and set a temporary password.

1. Otherwise, [sign in](https://www.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/welcome.xhtml?_m=1).

1. Click **Register a Domain**.

### Update the account information

Specify [three points of contact]({{base.url}}/domains/registration/points-of-contact/).

The administrative contact approves all content and must be a government employee. The technical contact is usually responsible for the DNS.

Each point of contact (POC) must be unique. If a POC already has a username in the system, include their name and username.

### Complete your DNS information

If you know the [name server addresses]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/dns/) for your new domain, enter them now. You have up to 90 days from the registration request to add the name servers. Otherwise, your request may become deactivated and the domain name released for others to use.

Please note that your domain will not be active in the .gov zone until the name servers are answering authoritatively.

### Submit your authorization letter

1. Click **Submit**.

1. Fax your authorization letter to 540-301-0160 or email a copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

After we receive your authorization letter and DNS test pass, you’ll receive an email that allows you to activate the domain.

## Questions?

If you have any questions during the registration process, contact us at <registrar@dotgov.gov> or 1-877-734-4688.
