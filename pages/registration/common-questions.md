### Who needs to be listed as a point of contact for a domain?

Each domain must have three points of contact. There will be no one single point of contact. Each contact must have the authority to access the Dotgov.gov registration system.

#### 1. Administrative contact

The administrative contact must be from the signatory’s office. As an example, for a state domain, it must be someone in the governor’s office.

#### 2. Technical contact

The technical contact must be available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week if this domain is critical to your infrastructure.

#### 3. Billing contact

The billing contact must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

### What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

### Do I need to enter DNS information when I submit my registration request?

You can add DNS at any time once the domain name request has been submitted. Note: Your domain cannot be activated until you add DNS.

### Why won’t my domain work after updating the registration with actual name servers?

Adding name servers to a reserved domain does not change its status from reserved to active if other requirements are pending. You are permitted to reserve a domain for up to 90 days, giving you time to submit all of the required registration information.

If the name server information is the only remaining information required for registration, it will take approximately 1 to 2 days following receipt of valid name server data for .gov Domain Registration Services to activate your domain. Expect an additional 1 to 2 days for the update to propagate across the Internet.

### Our CIO won’t sign our authorization letter. What do we do now?

Without an authorization letter from your mayor or the highest ranking city or county official, the state governor, the state CIO, or the federal CIO of your federal agency, you cannot register for a .gov domain name.

### My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the General Services Administration ([https://www.gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov)). Please contact the Domain Registration Help Desk with any questions you may have.
