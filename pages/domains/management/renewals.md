## Renewals

#### Where can I get a list of domains that are up for renewal?

On [www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov), from the Home Tab click on Fees.

#### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Domain name(s) must be renewed annually. POCs are sent renewal reminder emails at various intervals. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your .Gov domain name(s) are removed from active status, any services attached to such domain name(s) may experience issues.

#### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain name(s) do not automatically get removed from the zone. If you do not wish to renew, a registered POC must submit written consent requesting removal of the domain, otherwise, the agency will be held financially responsible for registration fees under Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35 and Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40. Written consent can be emailed to the Help Desk at registrar@dotgov.gov.
