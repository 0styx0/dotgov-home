### Fees FAQ
#### What payment methods do you accept?

We can only accept credit card payments.

#### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Annually. As a point of contact, you’ll receive several reminder emails. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your .gov domain names are removed from active status, services attached to them may experience issues.

#### What happens if I fail to submit a payment?

Failure to submit payment does not result in removal of your domain. The entity or agency will be held financially responsible for all accrued registration fees under [Final Rule 41 CFR Part 102-173.35 and 102-173.40](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=pt41.3.102_6173&rgn=div5#se41.3.102_6173_150). Your agency or office will not be able to register new domains until your account is up to date.

If you do not wish to renew, please follow the instructions to [delete your domain]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/renewals/#what-happens-if-i-do-not-renew-my-domain-name).


### Domain requirements and authorization FAQ
#### What are the requirements for a domain's three points of contact?

Each domain must have three unique points of contact, which your authorization letter must detail:

1. **Administrative contact**: someone from the signatory’s office that will approve the content. This person must be a government employee. As an example, for a state domain, it must be someone in the governor’s office.

2. **Technical contact**: a developer or site administrator that is available 24 hours a day and 7 days a week if the domain is critical to your infrastructure. They are usually responsible for the [DNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/dns/).

3. **Billing contact**: a person with access to a government credit card and the ability to pay registration fees.

There must be no one single point of contact.

Each contact must have the authority to access the .gov registrar. If a contact already has a .gov registrar username, please include it along with their name.

#### How do I request an exception to the naming conventions?

Exceptions to the [naming conventions]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#naming-conventions) can be requested in the authorization letter. For cities and counties, we have [outlined some circumstances]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#city-and-county-exception-requests) where we may grant an exception.

#### My authorizing authority won’t sign an authorization letter. What do I do now?

Without a letter signed by the party defined in our [domain requirements](https://home.dotgov.gov/registration/requirements/) as the authorizing authority for your organization, you cannot register a .gov domain name.

#### My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov). Please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/) with any questions you may have.

### DNS FAQ
#### What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

#### Why won’t my domain work after updating the registration with actual name servers?

Adding name servers to a reserved domain does not change its status from reserved to active if other requirements are pending. You are permitted to reserve a domain for up to 90 days, giving you time to submit all of the required registration information.

If the name server information is the only remaining information required for registration, it will take approximately 1 to 2 days following receipt of valid name server data for .gov Domain Registration Services to activate your domain. Expect an additional 1 to 2 days for the update to propagate across the Internet.
