## Points of Contact
Keeping point of contact (POC) information from going stale ensures that only the appropriate people can make changes to your domain. It also makes it possible for DotGov to reach your organization when there's an issue.

### How do we set up a new point of contact?

Request an account by sending an email to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

For a new domain request, the [authorization letter]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/authorization-templates/) must also list the person’s name as a valid contact.

### How do I change a point of contact on the account?

**If the point of contact is new** and doesn't have a account of the .gov registrar, they can create one in the Account section of [domains.dotgov.gov](https://domains.dotgov.gov/dotgov-web/user/register_registrant.xhtml?_m=2).

**If the point of contact already has an account** on the .gov registrar, please provide the username for the account and which point of contact the user will replace. If the new point of contact does not currently have an account, please send the name and contact information so an account can be set up for them. For federal level domains the email must come from a government employee.

**If all three points of contact have left the domain**, the Authorizing Authority must sign a new authorization letter and assign 3 more points of contact.

Review our [account information guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/#account-information) for more details.

### One of our contacts is no longer the right person to help manage our domain. How do I remove them from the account?

If you are a contact on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you can update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you’re selecting an existing user.

If you are unable to update a point of contact with an existing user, please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}/support/).

### Can one person serve as multiple POCs on a single domain?

No. All POCs on a domain must be **_unique_** to prevent a single point of failure. Each domain will require three (3) distinct POCs before submitting a request for approval or before submitting a renewal payment.

### Can one person serve as a POC on multiple domains?

Yes.


## Renewals and deletions

### How long is a .gov domain registered?

Domains are registered for a 1-year period and are renewed annually.

### Where can I get a list of domains that are up for renewal?

On [dotgov.gov](https://domains.dotgov.gov), from the Home Tab, click **Fees**.

### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Domain names must be renewed annually. Points of contact are sent renewal reminder emails at various intervals. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your domain names are removed from active status, any services attached to such domain names may experience issues.

### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain names are not automatically removed from the zone. If you do not wish to renew, please contact us to [delete the domain]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/#how-do-i-delete-my-domain). Otherwise, your agency will be held financially responsible for registration fees under [Final Rule 41 CFR Part 102-173.35 and 102-173.40](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=pt41.3.102_6173&rgn=div5#se41.3.102_6173_150).

### How do I delete my domain?

If you need to change or a delete a domain name, [contact us](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov) from an account registered to the domain.

Please include a request to remove the resource records from the zone file on the name servers hosting the domain.

**Note:** Once a domain is deleted, the entire [registration process]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/) must be initiated to resurrect that domain. Please be sure you need to delete a domain name before contacting us as it is irreversible.
