Bona fide government services should be **easy to identify on the internet.** The DotGov Program, part of the [General Services Administration](https://www.gsa.gov/), operates the .gov top-level domain (TLD) and makes it available to US-based government organizations, from federal agencies to local municipalities. Using a .gov domain shows you’re an official government organization.

We make it easy to register a .gov domain name and ensure that the name resolves in the global domain name system ([DNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/#dns)). DNS maps easy-to-remember names on top of hard-to-recall numbers, allowing you to use `gsa.gov` instead of `54.85.132.205`.

Since .gov domains are intertwined with access to government services, we work to make .gov a **trusted, secure, and authoritative space**: we publish our [policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/), recommend [security best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/security-best-practices/), and make .gov domain [data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/) publicly available.

As the policy and management authority for the .gov TLD, we put US governments on the internet, but there are some things we *don’t* do. DotGov doesn’t provide managed DNS services, host .gov websites or email, or monitor all .gov network traffic.

If you're an official US government organization, **we're here to help**. Contact us at <registrar@dotgov.gov>.
