### How do I delete my domain?

If you need to change or a delete a domain name, we must [receive an email](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov) from one of the domainâ€™s registered points of contact.

In addition to requesting the domain to be deleted, the domain owner should request that the resource records be removed from the zone file on the nameservers hosting the domain.

Once a domain is deleted, the entire registration process must be initiated in order to resurrect that domain. Please be sure you need to delete a domain name before contacting us as it is irreversible.
