The current cost of a .gov domain name is $400 per year.

### What payment methods do you accept?

We can only accept credit card payments.

### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Annually. As a point of contact, you’ll receive several reminder emails. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your .gov domain names are removed from active status, services attached to them may experience issues.

### What happens if I don’t renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain names do not automatically get removed from the zone. If you do not wish to renew, a registered point of contact must submit written consent requesting removal of the domain, otherwise, the agency will be held financially responsible for registration fees under [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa/dotgov-home/site-updates/policies-and-guidelines/policy-faq/#sec-102-17335-who-authorizes-domain-names) and [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40](/policies-and-guidelines/policy-faq/#sec-102-17345-is-there-a-registration-charge-for-domain-names). Written consent can be emailed to the Help Desk at registrar@dotgov.gov.

### What happens if I fail to submit a payment?

Failure to submit payment does not result in removal of your domain. The entity or agency will be held financially responsible for all accrued registration fees under [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/preview/gsa/dotgov-home/site-updates/policies-and-guidelines/policy-faq/#sec-102-17335-who-authorizes-domain-names) and [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40](/policies-and-guidelines/policy-faq/#sec-102-17345-is-there-a-registration-charge-for-domain-names).

Your entity or agency will not be able to acquire new domains until your account is up to date. If you wish to delete your domain, a registered point of contact must submit written consent requesting deletion to the Help Desk at <registrar@dotgov.gov>.

## 2017 fee increase

### Why did the fees increase?

The DotGov program is not supported by appropriated funds, and domain registration fees help to alleviate the rising costs of hosting services, including helping to combat growing cyber threats against the U.S. government.

### Who sets the registration and renewal fees?

The Office of Information, Integrity, and Access in the Office of Government-wide Policy, General Services Administration (GSA). GSA is designated as the Top Level Domain owner and Domain Policy Authority for governmental entities in the United States, including federal, state, local and tribal governments.

### When did fee increase take effect?

The fee increase took effect on January 1, 2017.

### When was the last fee increase?

There were no fee increases in the past. The original fee of $125 was set by GSA in June 2004.

### Is the fee the same for everyone who registers or renews a domain?

Yes, the fee is the same for new registrations and annual renewals.

### When was the fee increase announced?

The increase was announced in the [Federal Register](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/21/2016-09294/notice-of-fee-amounts-to-be-set-by-the-general-services-administrations-request-for-the-registration) on April 14, 2016, and posted on the [dotgov.gov](https://dotgov.gov) homepage.
