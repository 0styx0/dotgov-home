### How long is a .gov domain registered?

Domains are registered for a 1-year period and are renewed annually.

### Where can I get a list of domains that are up for renewal?

On [dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov), from the Home Tab, click **Fees**.

### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Domain names must be renewed annually. Points of contact are sent renewal reminder emails at various intervals. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your domain names are removed from active status, any services attached to such domain names may experience issues.

### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain names are not automatically removed from the zone. If you do not wish to renew, please contact us to [delete the domain]({{ site.baseurl }} /management/#how-do-i-delete-my-domain). Otherwise, your agency will be held financially responsible for registration fees under [Final Rule 41 CFR Part 102-173.35 and 102-173.40](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2003-03-28/html/03-7413.htm).
