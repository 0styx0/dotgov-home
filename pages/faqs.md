## Fee Increase

#### What's the reason for the fee increase?

The DotGov program is not supported by appropriated funds, and domain registration fees help to alleviate the rising costs of hosting services, including helping to combat growing cyber threats against the U.S. government.

#### Who sets the registration and renewal fee for .gov domains?

The Office of Information, Integrity, and Access (I2A) in the Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), General Services Administration (GSA).

GSA is designated as the Top Level Domain (TLD) owner and Domain Policy Authority for governmental entities in the United States, including federal, state, local and tribal governments.

#### When was the last fee increase?

There were no fee increases in the past. The original (and current) fee of $125 was set by GSA in June 2004.

#### When will the fee increase take effect?

The fee increase will take effect January 1, 2017.

#### If I pay my fee before January 1, 2017, will I pay the old fee or the new fee?

The old fee. All fees paid by December 31, 2016 will be at the $125 rate. The fee will increase to $400 per year on January 1, 2017.

> Payment Scenario Examples:
>
> **I receive a billing reminder on November 15, 2016, stating that my domain is due for renewal on January 15, 2017.**
>
> * If you pay the renewal prior to January 1, 2017, the fee will be $125​. Your next domain renewal will be due January 15, 2018.
> * If you pay your renewal between January 1-15, 2017, the fee will be $400​.
Your next domain renewal will be due January 15, 2018.
> * Fees will not be prorated.

#### Can I renew my domain more than 90 days in advance and take advantage of the lower fee?

No. Domains may only be renewed within a 90 day billing window, so only domains that are scheduled for renewal during January 1, 2017 – March 28, 2017, can take advantage of the lower fee by renewing early (no later than December 31, 2016).

#### How do I renew your domain within the 90 day renewal window?

A billing POC for each domain will receive an email notification that his/her domain/s are eligible for renewal at 90, 60, and 30 days of eligibility. At that time, the billing POC can log into the DotGov Registration portal at dotgov.gov and follow the procedures for domain payment. Please note that if he/she has to pay for more than one domain, each domain has to be paid for separately.

#### Is the fee the same for everyone who registers / renews a domain?

Yes, the fee is the same for both new registrations and annual renewals.

#### When was the fee increase announced?

The increase was announced in the [Federal Register on April 14, 2016](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/04/21/2016-09294/notice-of-fee-amounts-to-be-set-by-the-general-services-administrations-request-for-the-registration), and posted on the [dotgov.gov homepage](https://www.dotgov.gov).

## Accounts and Points of Contact (POC)

#### What is a POC?

A POC serves as a contact on a domain. There are three types: Billing, Technical, and Administrator.

#### Can one person serve as multiple POCs on a single domain?

No. All POCs on a domain must be **_unique_** to prevent a single point of failure. Each domain will require three (3) distinct POCs before submitting a request for approval or before submitting a renewal payment.

#### Can one person serve as a POC on multiple domains?

Yes.

#### One of the POCs is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. We need to remove him/her. How do I do that?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.

To change a single POC on the account, the Administrative POC will need to send an email to <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>, and request the change of POC. If the new POC already has an account on the system, please provide the Username for the account and which POC the user will replace. If the new POC does not currently have an account, please send the name and contact information to <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a> so an account can be set up for them. For federal level domains, the email must come from a Government employee.

If all three POCs have left the domain, The Authorizing Authority must assign 3 more POCs in a new authorization letter.

The Guidelines for the Gov Domain section 1, h., states:

It is the registrant's responsibility to provide all requested information and keep all account information current, to include POC information, DNS information and ensure the account is paid in full each year. Government domains / websites can be very large, complex and support important business operations. The process to address policy violations will allow for coordination across organizational boundaries and involve persons with the authority to make decisions on the appropriate course of action and in the time frame required.  The Administrative POC is the person who controls the content and is the manager of the operations of the domain.  The Technical POC is the person that operates the DNS and takes care of technical operations such as security patches, programming, etc. The Billing POC is the person that pays for the domain. The Authorizing Authority (AA) is the highest IT official or highest elected official that authorizes the domain to operate and contain information reference to their government responsibilities. The AA for Federal Agency domains is the CIO. The AA for State level domains is the Governor or their appointed CIO. The AA for local governments and Native Sovereign Nations is the highest elected official or the highest IT official.

## Domain Registration

#### How do I register a .gov domain?

To register a domain, please review the materials located on the Registration Process tab.

#### Do I need to enter DNS information when I submit my registration request?

You can add DNS at any time once the domain name request has been submitted. Note: Your domain cannot be activated until you add DNS.

#### My request was denied. What is the appeal process?

In October 1997, the Federal Networking Council delegated full responsibility for .gov domain registration to the General Services Administration ([https://www.gsa.gov](https://www.gsa.gov)). Please contact the Domain Registration Help Desk with any questions you may have.

Toll-free: (877) REG-GOVT or (877) 734-4688<br/>
E-mail: <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>

#### How long is a .Gov domain registered?

Domains are registered for a 1 year period and are renewed annually.

#### If a POC for a domain is new, are there any steps that this person needs to take to become the POC?

Yes, a new POC must first request an account by sending an email to Help Desk at <a href="mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov">registrar@dotgov.gov</a>. For a new domain request, the authorization letter must list the POC as a valid contact. Please go to <a href="https://www.dotgov.gov"> and then go to Home < Forms for this authorization letter template.

#### What are the valid characters for a domain name and how long can it be?

A domain name may be up to 26 characters long, including the 4 characters used to identify the top-level domain (e.g., `.gov`). The only valid characters for a domain name are letters, numbers and a hyphen. Other characters, including a space, are not permitted. Domain names may not begin or end with a hyphen.

#### What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

The Admin POC must be from the signatory's office. For example, the Admin POC for a new state domain name must be in the governor's office. The Technical POC must be available 24/7 if this .Gov domain name is critical to your infrastructure. The Billing POC must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

#### One of the POCs is no longer the right person to help manage a domain. We need to remove him/her. How do I do that?

If you are a POC on a domain that is undergoing the request process, you may update the POC with another. However, please ensure that you are selecting an existing user. If your POC is new, that individual must be provisioned into the system beforehand by selecting Account on the login page ([www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov)). Please review [the corresponding FAQ section](#one-of-the-pocs-is-no-longer-the-right-person-to-help-manage-a-domain-we-need-to-remove-himher-how-do-i-do-that) for more details.

If you are unable to update a POC with an existing user, please contact the Help Desk.

#### Our CIO won't sign our authorization letter. What do we do now?

Without an Authorization Letter from your Mayor or the highest ranking city or county official, the State Governor, the State CIO, or the Federal CIO of your Federal agency, you cannot register for a .gov domain name.

#### Who is the Indian Affairs CIO representative?

**Bureau of Indian Affairs**<br/>
**Office of Information Development**<br/>
**Attn: Angel Goldtooth, Imelda Tapang,**<br/>
12220 Sunrise Valley Drive Rm 5110<br/>
Reston, VA 20191<br/>

Tel: 505-563-5457<br/>
**[Imelda.Tapang@bia.gov](mailto:Imelda.Tapang@bia.gov)**<br/>
Tel: 703-390-6696

#### Are states eligible to receive a .gov domain?

Yes, states are eligible to receive a .gov domain name if the authorization letter is signed by the Governor or State CIO.

#### Where do I send my Authorization Letter?

Fax your letter to: (540) 301-0160 or email a digital copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

## Domain Management

#### How do I reset my password?

If you do not recall your password, please contact the Help Desk and a temporary password will be generated for you. You will be prompted to change your password for security protocols.

#### How quickly will modifications to my domain propagate throughout the Internet?

Propagation depends on a variety of factors, such as caching and connectivity, the changes are usually effective by the next morning.

#### What are the steps that should be taken to remove a domain and delete it from the .gov system?

Only a registered POC on a domain may request deletion of a domain by sending an email to the .GOV Registrar at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov). In addition to requesting the domain to be deleted, the domain owner should request the resource records for that domain to be removed from the zone file on the nameservers hosting the domain.

#### Why won't my domain work after updating the registration with actual name servers?

Adding name servers to a reserved domain does not change its status from reserved to active if other requirements are pending. You are permitted to reserve a domain for up to 90 days, giving you time to submit all of the required registration information.

If the name server information is the only remaining information required for registration, it will take approximately 1 to 2 days following receipt of valid name server data for .gov Domain Registration Services to activate your domain. Expect an additional 1 to 2 days for the update to propagate across the Internet.

#### Where can I get a list of domains that are up for renewal?

On [www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov), from the Home Tab click on Fees.

#### How do I transfer ownership of a domain name from one organization to another organization (such as from one agency to another agency)?

To transfer ownership of a domain name from one agency to another agency, two letters must be submitted to the .Gov Domain Manager - one from the transferring agency and one from the accepting agency.

The letter from the transferring agency must be on official agency letterhead and signed by the transferring agency chief information officer (CIO). The letter should formally request that the domain name be transferred to the new agency and should include the following information:

* Both agency names (transferring agency and accepting agency)
* Domain name to be transferred
* Current POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the transferring agency)
* New POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the accepting agency).

The letter from the accepting agency must be on official agency letterhead and must be signed by the accepting agency CIO.

This letter must specify the request for ownership of the domain name and should include the following information:

* Both agency names (transferring agency and accepting agency)
* Domain name to be transferred
* Current POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the transferring agency)
* New POC(s) and phone number(s) (for the accepting agency) and
* New domain name server (DNS) information.

Request letters should be faxed to the attention of the .Gov Domain Manager, at (540) 301-0160 or email a digital copy to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov). After the .Gov Domain Manager has received and verified both letters, the .Gov Domain Registration database will be updated to reflect the transfer.

## Fees

#### What are current registration fees?

The current cost of a .gov domain name is $400 per year.

#### How often do I need to renew my domain name?

Domain name(s) must be renewed annually. POCs are sent renewal reminder emails at various intervals. Please note that if your domain names are not kept current, they will be removed from active status. If any of your .Gov domain name(s) are removed from active status, any services attached to such domain name(s) may experience issues.

#### What is the form of payment for .gov domain names?

The only form of payment that is accepted is credit cards. We do not accept any other form of payment.

#### What happens if I do not renew my domain name?

If a renewal payment is not submitted, domain name(s) do not automatically get removed from the zone. If you do not wish to renew, a registered POC must submit written consent requesting removal of the domain, otherwise, the agency will be held financially responsible for registration fees under Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35 and Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40. Written consent can be emailed to the Help Desk at registrar@dotgov.gov.

What happens if I fail to sumit a payment?
Failure to submit payment does not result in removal of your domain. The entity or agency will be held financially responsible for all accrued registration fees under [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.35](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=pt41.3.102_6173&rgn=div5) and [Final Rule - 41 CFR Part 102-173.40](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?mc=true&node=pt41.3.102_6173&rgn=div5). Your entity or agency will not be able to acquire new domains until your account is up to date.  If you wish to delete your domain, a registered POC must submit written consent requesting deletion to the Help Desk at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

## Technical Questions

#### Why can't I access systems within my domain, but people outside can?

To speed up the entire DNS process, name servers will temporarily store IP addresses that they have found. This means that if someone in the office next to you visits [www.dotgov.gov](https://www.dotgov.gov) and then you visit the site shortly afterwards, you receive the IP address from the local, temporary storage rather than through the root servers. If you or your ISP's local name server is not "expiring" this temporary storage (called a cache), you could be getting incorrect IP addresses while people connected through different ISPs are getting the correct information. Please contact your ISP or local technical support for assistance.

#### Where do I look for the authoritative .gov zone data?

The root servers (e.g., a.root-server.net - j.root-server.net) are the authoritative source of .gov information that is "live" on the Internet.

## Customer Service

#### What are the hours of operations for the Registration Help Desk?

The Registration Help Desk is open on U.S. government working days from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Eastern and 24/7 for emergencies.

## Cloud Signing Service

#### What is the Cloud Signing Service?

The Cloud Signing Service eliminates many of the administrative burdens of the technical DNSSEC signing and management process. The service performs the initial cryptographic signing, the regular re-signing of zone resource records and the ongoing management of key rollover schedules and the associated zone re-signing.

#### How do I get started with the Cloud Signing Service?

* Existing unsigned .gov zone:  You have an existing, active domain name, and your zone is not DNSSEC enabled (or in other words, your zone is not signed by you or any external DNSSEC provider).  If you are not currently signed with any DNSSEC provider, you are eligible to enroll with the Cloud Signing Service.
* Existing signed zone with Algorithm 8: You or your provider is signing your zone with Algorithm 8 (RSA/SHA-256) and you want to switch to Cloud Signing Service.  Automatic enrollment for transferring DNSSEC providers is not supported at this time.  This process can be done manually.  For additional details, please contact the Helpdesk at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).
* Existing signed zone with other Algorithm: You or your provider is signing your zone with an Algorithm other than Algorithm 8 and you want to switch to Cloud Signing Service. Automatic enrollment for transferring DNSSEC providers is not supported at this time.  This process can be done manually.  For additional details, please contact the Helpdesk at [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

#### If I am currently enrolled in the Key Monitoring Service, do I still need to enroll in the Cloud Signing Service?

The Cloud Signing Service and Key Monitoring Service are different services. Enrolling in Key Monitoring will not automatically enroll you in the Cloud Signing Service. The Key Monitoring Service enables monitoring of a child zone for any new KSKs and automatically adds the DS corresponding to the new KSK. This will also send notifications when the ROLLOVER is successfully completed, when an RRSIG expiry is within certain thresholds, and also when there is a Child Key Error. The Cloud Signing Service will perform the initial signing and ongoing key management for your zone. If you do not need a DNSSEC signing service, you do not need to enroll into Cloud Signing Service. However, if you do need a DNSSEC signing service for your zone, and wish to take advantage of the Cloud Signing Service, you will need to explicitly enroll into Cloud Signing Service. The Key Monitoring enrollment alone will not provide the initial and ongoing signing that is required for a DNSSEC enabled zone.

If your domain is enrolled in the Key Monitoring Service, it will stay enrolled into that service even after you enroll into the Cloud Signing Service.

If your domain is not already enrolled into the Key Monitoring Service and you choose to enroll in the Cloud Signing Service, the system will automatically enroll you into the Key Monitoring Service. Customers have the option to de-enroll from Key Monitoring if they want, however, this is not recommended. Please note that if you choose to remove your domain from the Key Monitoring Service, it will be your responsibility to submit the appropriate DS information into the .gov UI.

#### What is a TSIG?

The Cloud Signing Service requires the use of TSIG (Transaction Signature) to provide the secure transfer of zone data by allowing your designated nameservers to authenticate to our nameservers. It also allows our   nameservers to check the integrity of the zone data transferred. Please note that TSIG requires that you run BIND version 8.2 or later.

Where do I enter my TSIG key?

Enter your TSIG key information along with the nameserver information. You will also need to do the following:

* Add a key statement to your 'named.conf' file
* Add an "allow-transfers" sub-statement to your zone's statement.

Please note that this requires BIND version 8.2 or later.

#### What do I do if I don't have a TSIG key?

If you do not have a TSIG key, you may generate a TSIG key through the "Customer Nameservers" tab. You will then need to add a key statement to your 'named.conf' file and an "allow-transfers" sub-statement to your zone's zone statement.

#### Why do I need to configure my nameservers for the Cloud Signing Service?

The new zone added to the service will not be signed until your source nameserver and destination nameserver have been configured to allow zone transfer out and in respectively from the Cloud Signing Service source and destination nameservers.

The following steps are what may be followed in a typical set up for the Cloud Signing Service:

* Identify your Source and Destination nameservers. (The Source nameserver should be able to serve your UNSIGNED zone. Your Destination nameserver may or may not be your Active nameserver)
* Set up a TSIG for them (you can generate one or ask Cloud Signing Service to generate it for you when adding your nameservers)
* Make sure your nameservers support zone transfer using AXFR.
* Make sure your firewall for both source and destination nameservers allow the following IPs on port 53:

    72.13.32.91<br/>
    69.58.186.91<br/>
    72.13.32.92<br/>
    69.58.186.92<br/>
    72.13.32.93<br/>
    69.58.186.93<br/>
    72.13.32.94<br/>
    69.58.186.94

* Login to dotGOV UI and go to the Domain Update page for your domain.
* Enroll your domain into Cloud Signing Service from here.
* Cloud Signing Service will sign your zone and then the signed zone will be transferred back to your destination name server
* Make sure the signed zone is published to your active name servers (if different from Destination)
* The DS record will be automatically added to the .GOV zone within 24 hours from signing.

#### When does the Cloud Signing Service communicate with my source/destination nameservers?

* The service shall query the customer primary/ backup nameservers under the following scenarios:
* When your source nameserver(s) issues NOTIFY, the Cloud Signing Service requests AXFR from that source nameserver(s) ONLY.
* When the Cloud Signing Service initiates a SOA query/ AXFR request for a new zone or expiry of refresh interval, then the service fails over to the backup customer nameserver if communication to the first server fails
* When the signed zone is ready the Cloud Signing Service, we will notify your destination nameservers.
* When your destination nameserver(s) initiates a query, the Cloud Signing Service will respond to your server

#### How does a zone transfer occur?

For both of these processes the common DNS AXFR protocol is utilized. There are no custom APIs or protocols that are needed in order to transfer zone data into and out of the Cloud Signing Service.

#### What happens when a zone is added?

The Cloud Signing Service first requests a DNS transfer (AXFR) from your nameserver. The service signs the zone and informs the customer systematically that the zone is ready to be picked up and processed.

#### What are the keys that are generated to sign the zone?

Once a zone is added to the service and the transfer is successful the first step in the signing process involves generating the necessary keys to sign the zone. This includes a KSK and a ZSK. The public key of the KSK and ZSK are stored in DNSKEY RRs in the zone file and the private key is stored within our secure infrastructure.

#### What is a KSK?

The Key Signing Key (KSK) is an authentication key that corresponds to a private key used to sign one or more other keys for a given zone. With this service the private key corresponding to a KSK will sign the ZSK, which in turn has a corresponding private key that will sign other data in your zone.

#### What is a ZSK?

Zone Signing Key (ZSK) is an authentication key that corresponds to a private key used by this service to sign data in your zone.

#### What is the key pre-publish period?

Keys are required to be pre-published before the active key expires to allow time for the DS record to be updated in the parent zone (for a KSK) and to accommodate resolvers that may have cached the prior signed zone and are still referencing the signatures created by the previously active keys.

* The Pre-publish period for the KSK will be for a period of 2 months.
* The Pre-publish period for the ZSK will be for a period of 1 week.

#### What is the key active period?

The active period is the time during which the keys (KSK or ZSK) will be active. Following this period the keys will be rolled over and the pre published key will become the active key.

* Active period for KSK is 2 years and for ZSK is 3 months.
* The active period for the KSK will be for a period of 2 years.
* The active period for the ZSK will be for a period of 3 months.

#### What is the key post-publish period?

The keys will be published in the zone for a predetermined post-publish period after the active end date. This is to accommodate resolvers that may have cached the prior signed zone and are still referencing the signatures created by the previously active keys.

* The post-publish period for the KSK will be for a period of 2 months.
* The post-publish period for the ZSK will be for a period of 1 week.

#### What is the signature validity period?

The Signature validity period is the periods through which the signature is valid.

It starts at the time specified in the signature inception field of the RRSIG RR and ends at the time specified in the expiration field of the RRSIG RR. The Cloud Signing Service currently assigns a signature validity period of 14 days for all zones and all signatures in zones. It will attempt to re-sign each zone again in about 7 days to ensure that a published zone never has invalid signatures.

#### How often is the zone signed?

The zone is signed every time your zone file is updated, or every 7 days, whichever comes first.

#### How often are the keys rolled?

The Cloud Signing Service will support a fixed schedule for all KSKs and ZSKs. The fixed schedule will include the following: Key pre publish period; Key Active period; and Key post publish period for all KSKs and ZSKs. Key Rollovers will occur on the following schedules:

* The KSK will be available for a fixed interval of two (2) years
* The ZSK will be available for a fixed interval of three (3) months

The KSK and ZSK will be active until the scheduled rollover date or until an emergency key rollover is requested. The service will not generate a new KSK or ZSK key every time the zone is signed. The same KSK and ZSK keys will be used until it is no longer active.

#### What is an emergency roll over?

In the unlikely event you feel that a key may have been compromised (KSK, ZSK or both), the Point of Contact for your domain may contact the Helpdesk at registrar@dotgov.gov to request an unscheduled/ emergency key rollover. After the Helpdesk completes the emergency key rollover request, the zone will be signed with the new keys.

#### What happens when an emergency KSK rollover is requested?

When an emergency KSK is requested the zone will be resigned with the compromised KSK and with either a

* new KSK, or
* if a KSK was already being pre-published, then that key will be made active
* Compromised KSK: The compromised KSK will be active for 1 week from rollover date, and post-published for 1 week.
* New KSK: The new KSK will be active following the rollover date. The new KSK will be valid for a period of 2 years from the emergency rollover date and will be post-published per usual post-publish period.

#### What happens when an emergency ZSK rollover is requested?

When an emergency ZSK is requested, the zone will be signed with the compromised ZSK for an additional 2 days from date of rollover request. After 2 days, the zone will be resigned with either a

* new ZSK, or
* If a ZSK was already being pre-published, then that key will be made active
* Compromised ZSK: The compromised ZSK is inactivated 2 days after the emergency rollover request and post-published for 2 days
* New ZSK: The new ZSK will be active starting 2 days from the rollover request date until 3 months from active date and will be post-published for the usual post-publish period

#### What happens when my zone is updated?

The Cloud Signing Service requires that you set up your source nameserver to use NOTIFY to alert our service's   nameservers of any zone data changes. If you are running BIND version 8 or later and use the NOTIFY function, your nameserver will alert our nameservers to provide automatic zone updates when they occur.

#### What is a DS record?

The DS (Delegation Signer) Resource Record (stored in the parent zone) refers to specific zones KSK DNSKEY RR (in the child zone) and is used in the DNSSEC authentication process (see RFC4035 section 5 for details on the authentication process). A DS RR refers to the KSKs DNSKEY RR by storing the key tag, algorithm number, and a digest of the DNSKEY RR. By authenticating the DS record, a resolver can authenticate the KSK DNSKEY RR to which the DS record points.

#### What are the notifications that will be sent to the domain's technical POC?

* KSK Rollover scheduled (2 month, 1 month, 2 weeks prior to KSK expiration)
* KSK Rollover successful
* KSK Post-Publish Period Complete
* Emergency KSK Rollover
* Emergency ZSK Rollover
* Signing Status Change Alert (to SOURCE-FAILED-XFER)
* Signing Status Change Alert (to SOURCE-SOA-QUERY-FAILED)
* Signing Status Change Alert (to DESTINATION-FAILED-XFER)

#### What are the different statuses in the service a zone can have once it is added?

The following are the possible statuses while transferring a Zone from the customer nameserver to our nameservers.

* SOURCE_PENDING_XFER – This status is shown when a new Zone is added and is pending transfer.
* SOURCE_OK – This status is shown when the transfer from the source nameserver succeeded.
* SOURCE_FAILED_XFER – This status is shown when the transfer from the source nameserver failed.
* SOA_QUERY_FAILED – This status is shown when the SOA record query failed.

#### What are some of the reasons of a failure of a source SOA query?

The source SOA query can fail for the following reasons:

* No connectivity to source nameserver
* Customer nameserver is not running.
* Customer nameserver does not have the zone yet
* Customer nameserver has the zone but does not recognize our virtual IP address (VIP) as slave yet
* ACL for source nameserver has not reached the Cloud Signing Service

Please note, that the service will retry the connectivity every 1 hour after each one of these failures.

#### What are some of the reasons when the source_failed_xfer status occurs?

The source transfer could fail because of one of the reasons listed above in 2.28 or when your nameserver has not properly configured the TSIG.

#### What resource records are supported in the Cloud Signing Service?

The DNSSEC Signing Service is has been tested been tested to ensure support of the following DNS Resource Record Types: A, AAAA, CNAME, DNAME, DNSKEY, DS, LOC, MX, NAPTR, NS, NSEC, NSEC3, PTR, RRSIG, SOA, SPI, SRV, SSHFP, TXT. Other record types may be supported but have not been validated in our testing.

#### What method is used authenticate the zone transfer?

The Cloud Signing Service uses DNS TSIG/TKEY for the transfer of Zones.
