Each domain must have three points of contact:

* Administrative contact
* Technical contact
* Billing contact

There will be no one single point of contact.

### What are the requirements to be assigned to domain names?

1. The administrative contact must be from the signatory’s office. As an example, for a state domain, it must be someone in the governor’s office.

2. The technical contact must be available 24/7 if this domain is critical to your infrastructure.

3. The billing contact must have access to a credit card and be able to pay registration fees.

All points of contact must have the authority to have an account on the Registration System.

If you need to change or a delete a domain name, we must [receive an email](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov) from a point of contact that is currently on the domain.

### How do we set up a new point of contact?

Request an account by sending an email to [registrar@dotgov.gov](mailto:registrar@dotgov.gov).

For a new domain request, the [authorization letter](/domains/registration/form-letters/) must also list the person’s name as a valid contact.
