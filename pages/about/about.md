intro: .gov puts US governments on the internet.

---
Bona fide government services should be easy to identify on the internet. The DotGov Program, part of the General Services Administration (GSA), operates the .gov top-level domain (TLD) and makes it available to U.S.-based government organizations, from Federal agencies to local municipalities.

We’re the policy and management authority for the .gov TLD. Our job is to make it easy to register a .gov domain name, and ensure that name resolves in the global domain name system (DNS). Since .gov domains are intertwined with access to government services, we know that .gov is critical infrastructure for governments, citizens, and international internet users.

Using a .gov domain shows you’re official, so we also work to make .gov a trusted, safe space. We publish our [policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/), recommend security best practices, and make .gov domain [data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/) publicly available.

We put US governments on the internet, but there are some things we *don’t* do. DotGov doesn’t provide managed DNS services, host .gov websites or email, or have visibility into .gov network traffic en masse.

We’re from the government and we're here to help. Contact us at <registrar@dotgov.gov>.
