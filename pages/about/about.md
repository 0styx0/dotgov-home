Bona fide government services should be **easy to identify on the internet.** The DotGov Program, part of the [Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency](https://www.cisa.gov), operates the .gov top-level domain (TLD) and makes it available to U.S.-based government organizations, from federal agencies to local municipalities. Using a .gov domain shows you’re official.

We make it easy to register a .gov domain name and ensure that the name resolves in the global domain name system ([DNS]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/#dns)). DNS maps easy-to-remember names on top of hard-to-recall numbers, allowing you to use `cisa.gov` instead of `23.201.86.157`.

.gov domains are intertwined with access to government services, and that makes .gov critical infrastructure for governments, citizens, and international internet users. We work to make .gov a **trusted, secure space**: we publish our [policies]({{ site.baseurl }}/registration/requirements/), recommend [security best practices]({{ site.baseurl }}/management/security-best-practices/), and make .gov domain [data]({{ site.baseurl }}/data/) publicly available.

We put U.S. governments on the internet, but there are some things we *don’t* do. DotGov doesn’t offer authoritative DNS services, host .gov websites or email, or monitor all .gov network traffic.

If you're from the government, **we're here to help**. Contact us at <registrar@dotgov.gov>.
