**April 26th, 2021**: .gov is now managed by CISA, and [.gov domains are available without cost](/2021/4/26/a-new-day-for-gov/) to qualifying U.S.-based government organizations. Weâ€™ve also updated the requirements to obtain and maintain a .gov domain.

**March 8, 2021:** The .gov top-level domain is moving to the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. See our [announcement](/moving-to-cisa).

**June 21, 2020:** We announced our [intent to preload the .gov TLD](/management/preloading/dotgovhttps) in the future. We believe the security benefits that come from preloading are meaningful and necessary to continue meeting the public&rsquo;s expectation of safety on .gov services.
