### Subpart A--General

<a name="1021735"><strong>Sec. 102-173.5 What is Internet GOV Domain?</strong></a>

Internet GOV Domain refers to the Internet top-level domain "dot- gov" operated by the General Services Administration for the registration of U.S. government-related domain names. In general, these names reflect the organization names in the Federal Government and non- Federal government entities in the United States. These names are now being used to promote government services and increase the ease of finding these services.

<a name="10217310"><strong>Sec. 102-173.10 What is the authority or jurisdiction of the Internet GOV Domain</strong></a>

  Jurisdiction of the Internet GOV (dot-gov) domain was delegated
  to the General Services Administration in 1997 by the Federal
  Networking Council with guidance in the form of Internet
  Engineering Task Force (IETF) Informational
  <a class="nl" href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2146.txt?number=2146" target="_blank">RFC 2146</a>.

  <a name="10217315">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.15 What is the scope of this part?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  This part addresses the registration of second-level domain
  names used in the Internet GOV Domain. This registration
  process assures that the assigned domain names are unique
  worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217320">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.20 To whom does this part apply?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  This part applies to Federal, State, and local governments, and
  Native Sovereign Nations. You do not need to register domain
  names with the General Services Administration if you will be
  using some other top-level domain registration, such as dot-us,
  dot-org, or dot-net.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217325">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.25 What definitions apply to this part?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  The following definitions apply to this part:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Domain</strong>
  is a region of jurisdiction on the Internet for naming
  assignment. The General Services Administration (GSA) is
  responsible for registrations in the dot-gov domain.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Domain name</strong>
  is a name assigned to an Internet server. This is the name that
  you request from GSA. Typically, you would apply this name to a
  domain name server. A domain name locates the organization or
  other entity on the Internet. The dot gov part of the domain
  name reflects the purpose of the organization or entity. This
  part is called the Top- Level Domain name. The Second-Level
  Domain name to the left of the dot gov maps to a readable
  version of the Internet address. The Domain Name server has a
  registry of Internet Protocol (IP) address numbers that relate
  to the readable text name.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Domain name server</strong>
  is the computer that provides pointers from the domain name to
  the actual computers.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Dot-gov</strong>
  refers to domain names ending with a ".gov" suffix.
  The Internet GOV domain is another way of
</p>
<p>[[Page 15091]]</p>
<p>expressing the collection of dot-gov domain names.</p>
<p>
  <strong>Native Sovereign Nations (NSN)</strong>
  are federally recognized tribes.


### Subpart B--Registration

  <a name="10217330">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.30 Who may register in the dot-gov
      domain?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  Registration in the dot-gov domain is available to official
  governmental organizations in the United States including
  Federal, State, and local governments, and Native Sovereign
  Nations.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217335">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.35 Who authorizes domain names?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  Domain names must be authorized by the Chief Information
  Officer (CIO) of the requesting or sponsoring governmental
  organization. For Federal departments and agencies, the General
  Services Administration (GSA) will accept authorization from
  the CIO of the department or agency. For independent Federal
  government agencies, boards, and commissions, GSA will accept
  authorization from the highest-ranking Information Technology
  Official. For State and local governments, GSA will accept
  authorization from appropriate State or local officials, see
  Sec. 102-173.40.
</p>
<p>For Native Sovereign Nations, GSA will only accept
  authorization from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Department of
  the Interior. In most cases, GSA will not make determinations
  on the appropriateness of the selected domain names, but
  reserves the right to not assign domain names on a case-by-case
  basis. Non-Federal government domain names must follow the
  naming conventions described in Sec. Sec. 102-173.50 through
  102-173.65. For other government entities, CIO's may delegate
  this authority by notification to GSA.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217340">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.40 Who is my Chief Information Officer
      (CIO)?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  Your Chief Information Officer (CIO) may vary according to the
  branch of government. For the Federal Government, the General
  Services Administration (GSA) recognizes the cabinet level CIOs
  listed at http://www.cio.gov.
</p>
<p>For States, GSA will accept authorization from the Office of
  the Governor or highest-ranking Information Technology (IT)
  official. Other officials include the Mayor (for city or town),
  County Commissioner (for counties) or highest ranking IT
  official. Native Sovereign Nations (NSN) must receive
  authorization from the Bureau of Indian Affairs. CIOs may
  delegate this authority by notification to GSA.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217345">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.45 Is there a registration charge for
      domain names?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  The General Services Administration (GSA) reserves the right to
  charge for domain names in order to recover cost of operations.
  For current registration charges, please visit the GSA Web site
  at http://www.dotgov.gov.
</p>
<p>GSA does not currently charge a fee. GSA has the authority to
  employ a system of collection that includes a one-time setup
  fee for new registrations, which will not exceed $1000,
  depending on the level of assistance that may be provided by
  GSA, and a recurring annual charge that will not exceed $500
  for all dot-gov domains. The fees are based on anticipated
  costs for operating the registration service.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217350">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.50 What is the naming convention for
      States?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  (a) To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, State
  government entities must register the full State name or
  clearly indicate the State postal code within the name.
  Examples of acceptable names include virginia.gov,
  tennesseeanytime.gov, wa.gov, nmparks.gov, mysc.gov,
  emaryland.gov, and ne-taxes.gov. However--
</p>
<p>(1) Use of the State postal code should not be embedded
  within a single word in a way that obscures the postal code.
  For example, Indiana (IN) should not register for win.gov, or
  independence.gov; and</p>
<p>(2) Where potential conflicts arise between postal codes and
  existing domain names, States are encouraged to register URL's
  that contain the full State name.</p>
<p>(b) There is no limit to the number of domain names for which
  a State may register.</p>
<p>(c) States are encouraged to make second-level domains
  available for third-level registration by local governments and
  State Government departments and programs. For example, the
  State of North Carolina could register NC.GOV as a second-level
  domain and develop a system of registration for their local
  governments. The State would be free to develop policy on how
  the local government should be registered under NC.GOV. One
  possibility might be to spell out the city, thus Raleigh.NC.gov
  could be a resulting domain name.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217355">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.55 What is the naming convention for
      Cities and Townships?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  (a) To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, City
  (town) governments must register the domain name with the city
  (town) name or abbreviation, and clear reference to the State
  in which the city (town) is located. However--
</p>
<p>(1) Use of the State postal code should not be embedded
  within a single word in a way that obscures the postal code;
  and</p>
<p>(2) Inclusion of the word city or town within the domain name
  is optional and may be used at the discretion of the local
  government.</p>
<p>(b)(1) The preferred format for city governments is to denote
  the State postal code after the city name, optionally separated
  by a dash.</p>
<p>
  Examples of preferred domain names include--
  <br />
  (i) Chicago-il.gov;
  <br />
  (ii) Cityofcharleston-sc.gov;
  <br />
  (iii) Charleston-wv.gov;
  <br />
  (iv) Townofdumfries-va.gov; and
  <br />
  (v) Detroitmi.gov.
</p>
<p>(2) GSA reserves the right to make exceptions to the naming
  conventions described in this subpart on a case-by-case basis
  in unique and compelling cases.</p>
<p>(c) If third-level domain naming is used, GSA reserves the
  right to offer exceptions to the third-level domain naming
  conventions described in this section on a case-by-case basis
  in unique and compelling cases.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217360">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.60 What is the naming convention for
      Counties or Parishes?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />(a)
  To register any second-level domain within dot-gov, County or
  Parish governments must register the County's or Parish's name
  or abbreviation, the word "county" or
  "parish" (because many counties have the same name as
  cities within the same State), and a reference to the State in
  which the county or parish is located. However, the use of the
  State postal code should not be embedded within a single word
  in a way that obscures the postal code.
</p>
<p>(b) The preferred format for county or parish governments is
  to denote the State postal code after the county or parish,
  optionally separated by a dash.</p>
<p>
  Examples of preferred domain names include--
  <br />
  (1) Richmondcounty-ga.gov;
  <br />
  (2) Pwc-county-va.gov; and
  <br />
  (3) Countyofdorchestor-sc.gov.
</p>
<p>(c) If third-level domain naming is available from the State
  government, counties or parishes are encouraged to register for
  a domain name under a State's registered second-level (e.g.,
  richmondcounty.ga.gov).</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217365">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.65 What is the naming convention for
      Native Sovereign Nations?</strong>
  </a>
</p>
<p>To register any second-level domain in dot-gov, Native
  Sovereign Nations (NSN) may register any second-level</p>
<p>[[Page 15092]]</p>
<p>domain name provided that it contains the registering NSN
  name followed by a suffix of "-NSN.gov" (case
  insensitive).</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217370">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.70 Where do I register my dot-gov domain
      name?</strong>
  </a>
</p>
<p>Registration is an online process at the General Services
  Administration's Web site at http://www.dotgov.gov. At the
  Network Information Site, you will find the instructions and
  online registration forms for registering your domain name. To
  register your domain name you will need to provide information
  such as your desired domain name, sponsoring organization,
  points of contact, and at least one name server addresses.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217375">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.75 How long does the process take?</strong>
  </a>
</p>
<p>The process can be completed within 48 hours if all
  information received is complete and accurate. Most requests
  take up to thirty (30) days because the registrar is waiting
  for Chief Information Officer (CIO) approval.</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217380">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.80 How will I know if my request is
      approved?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  A registration confirmation notice is sent within one business
  day after you register your domain name, informing you that
  your registration information was received. If all of your
  information is accurate and complete, a second notice will be
  sent to you within one business day, informing you that all of
  your information is in order. If you are ineligible, or if the
  information provided is incorrect or incomplete, your
  registration will be rejected and a notice will be sent to you
  stating the reason for rejection. Registration requests will be
  activated within two business days after receiving valid
  authorization from the appropriate Chief Information Officer
  (CIO). Once your domain name has been activated, a notice will
  be sent to you.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217385">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.85 How long will my application be held,
      pending approval by the Chief Information Officer (CIO)?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  Registrations will be held in reserve status for sixty (60)
  days pending Chief Information Officer (CIO) authorization from
  your sponsoring organization.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217390">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.90 Are there any special restrictions on
      the use and registration of canonical, or category names like
      recreation.gov?</strong>
  </a>
  <br />
  Yes, canonical names registration request must provide access
  coverage for the areas conveyed by the name. So the URL
  recreation.gov would not be approved for the state of Maryland,
  but the URL recreationMD.gov would be approved if it provides
  statewide coverage. The logic of the names adds value to the
  dot gov domain. GSA reserves the right deny use of canonical
  names that do not provide appropriate coverage and to arbitrate
  these issues.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="10217395">
    <strong>Sec. 102-173.95 Are there any restrictions on the use
      of the dot-gov domain name?</strong>
  </a>

The General Services Administration approves domain names for a specific term of time, generally two years unless otherwise stated, and under conditions of use. General conditions of registration and are posted at the registration Web site at http://www.dotgov.gov and may be modified over time. Organizations that operate web sites that are not in compliance with the conditions of use may have their domain name terminated.
